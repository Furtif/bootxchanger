## System Requirements

* Intel-based Macintosh
* Mac OS X 10.4 to 10.6

## Limitations

If your image has transparency, it will be redrawn over the background colour
before being applied, so save the original somewhere in case you want to change
the background colour later.

* Some macs will scale big images down when booting, or ignore the image if it's really big.
* Some newer macs may not accept any image, and only change the background colour.
* Has not been updated since 2010

## Usage

To set an image as a boot image, open BootXChanger and drag it to the image
well, and click Apply. You can also click the background colour to change it.
You will then be asked for an administrator password, as the boot image is
stored in a system file.
